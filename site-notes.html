<!-- there are block elements like:
<p> paragraph</p>
<h1> heading </h1>
<hr> horizontal rule

there are inline elements like:
<span> span</span> can be used to separate a portion of a block element -->

<!-- there are also inlin-block like:
<img src="" alt=""> images -->

<!-- and lastly none:
does not exist -->
<!-- 
block elements cannot be on the same line
inline elemenet cannot have their width changed
inline-blcok gives the best of both worlds
none treats the elemet to as if it does not exist

to change an element from one type to another, we simply has to style it (CSS) using the property "display: type" -->
